# üìä Linear Programming Optimization using PuLP - Task 4

---

## üìà Project Overview

This repository demonstrates a practical application of **Linear Programming (LP)** to solve real-world **optimization problems** using Python. The project utilizes the **PuLP library**, a powerful tool for modeling and solving linear optimization problems efficiently.

Through this task, I explored how to define and solve an LP problem involving **maximizing or minimizing an objective function** subject to **constraints**. Linear Programming is widely used in domains like supply chain management, finance, operations research, and resource allocation.

## üéØ Objective

- To design and solve a **Linear Programming problem** using Python.
- Learn how to **model constraints, decision variables, and objective functions** in code.
- Optimize a given objective function under real-world constraints.
- Use **PuLP** for easy formulation and solving of LP problems.

## üìä Problem Description

The project addresses a sample **resource allocation problem** where the goal is to **maximize profit or minimize cost** given certain resource constraints.

### Example Scenario:
- Suppose a factory produces two products **A** and **B**.
- Each product requires specific amounts of resources (e.g., time, labor, material).
- The company wants to **maximize total profit** while ensuring resource usage stays within available limits.

---

## üß© Workflow Breakdown

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Define Decision Variables
- `x` = number of units of Product A to produce
- `y` = number of units of Product B to produce

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Objective Function
- Maximize profit = `Profit_A * x + Profit_B * y`

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Constraints
- Resource constraints: time, labor, materials, etc.
- For example:
  - `Resource1_A * x + Resource1_B * y <= Available_Resource1`
  - `Resource2_A * x + Resource2_B * y <= Available_Resource2`
- Additional constraints like non-negativity: `x >= 0, y >= 0`

## üíª Sample Code Snippet

```python
import pulp

# Initialize the problem
model = pulp.LpProblem("Maximize_Profit", pulp.LpMaximize)

# Decision variables
x = pulp.LpVariable('x', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')
y = pulp.LpVariable('y', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')

# Objective function
model += 40 * x + 30 * y, "Total Profit"

# Constraints
model += 2 * x + y <= 100  # Resource 1
model += x + 2 * y <= 80   # Resource 2

# Solve
model.solve()
print(f"Optimal x = {x.varValue}")
print(f"Optimal y = {y.varValue}")
print(f"Max Profit = {pulp.value(model.objective)}")
```

## üìä Results & Insights

- The LP solver computes the **optimal values of decision variables** `x` and `y`.
- The **maximum profit** (or minimized cost) is also calculated.
- The results can be extended to more complex problems with multiple variables and constraints.

## üîç Applications

- **Business Strategy**: Optimize profit, cost, or output.
- **Logistics**: Route optimization, resource allocation.
- **Finance**: Portfolio optimization.
- **Manufacturing**: Product mix optimization under limited resources.
